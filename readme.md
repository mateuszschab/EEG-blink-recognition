## Basic Overview
The recorded signal from the electroencephalograph had to identify blinking in the test user. The identification of the left and right eye is based on the strength of the electrical signal of the dominant eye, which has a higher value.
The efficiency of the identification can be compared by recording the blinking to check the correctness.

## Tasks: 
1) Recognition of the left and right eye based on 8 trials
2) Recognition of the number of blinks based on 12 trials
3) Identification of left, right and blink of both eyes
4) Identification of all blinks based on peaks of the signal of the dominant eye
